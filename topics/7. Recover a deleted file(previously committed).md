# 7. Recover a deleted file(previously committed)
You are making new changes to your project and you see an obsolete file. You go ahead and delete the file so you free up space. Sometime later you realize that you need the file you just deleted.

To recover your file:<br>
`git restore deleted-file.css`<br>
This will present the file to you as it was in the previous commit.
