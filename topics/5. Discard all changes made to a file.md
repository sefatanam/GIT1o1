# 5. Discard all changes made to a file
You have modified your files in your local git repo. You later realize that changes you made to a particular file(connect.js) are not so intelligent and should be discarded. But you want to keep changes made to other files.

So you want the file `connect.js` to go back to the state it was in the previous commit.

This is possible with Git: <br>
`git restore connect.js`
