# 3. Modify the Last Commit Message
This scenario is similar to the one above. But this time, you have commited to git and you are not very happy with the commit message you specified. You want the message to have more meaning describing what you have done.

Again Git is forgiving to let you fix your previous crappy commit message.

Simply run:<br>
`git commit --amend -m "Phew! A better commit message this time"`
