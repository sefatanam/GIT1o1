# 9. Delete Untracked Files
You have created several new files in your project and also modified some files. You have changed your approach and you now decide that you no longer need any of these new files you have created but stick with the modified file changes.

Git provides you a command to remove untracked files: <br>
 `git clean -f` <br>

 The git clean command requires a -f flag implying the force directive(also --force). Since this operation entails deleting untracked files, it has to require that you are sure about what you are doing because getting rid of uncommitted work in Git is undoable

By default this command will not remove untracked folders or files specified by .gitignore. Specify the -x option to cause the removal of ignored files.

Also git clean will not operate recursively on directories. This is another safety mechanism to prevent accidental permanent deletion.

To also remove directiories, use -d flag like

``git clean -df``

This will clean untracked files and directories, but will not remove the ones listed in .gitignore file.
