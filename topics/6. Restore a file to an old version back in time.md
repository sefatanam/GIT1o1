# 6. Restore a file to an old version back in time
Unlike the above command, In this case you want a particular file in your project to go back to a state that is deeper back in time than the previous commit.

So for example if version 3 was your previous commit, you want this particular file to appear as it was in version 2 which is earlier than version 3.

With Git:

Find and copy the commit hash back in time you want

``
git log
``
<br>Then,<br>
``
git restore --source <commit-hash> <filename>
``
