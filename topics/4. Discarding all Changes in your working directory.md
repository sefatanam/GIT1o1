# 4. Discarding all Changes in your working directory

You are working on your project. For example, you may be refactoring your code to follow better patterns and clean code principles. While refactoring, you break a functionality in the application and cannot get your head around what really went wrong. You now want to go back to the previous state(commit) where the application was working fine so that you can find your bearing again.

So you want to discard all the uncommitted changes you have made and restore your Git working tree back to the state it was in when the last commit took place.

Use the command: <br>
`git restore .`

<br>
Note: This command restores your working copy to the most recent commit in your local git database. Changes that you have not committed will be lost permanently.
